# Spaghetti_Graveyard
Spaghetti Graveyard will be an RPG similar to games from the Diablo franchise. The major selling point is that whenever a player attacks a monster, the player will be asked to solve a maths question.


This code was written long ago when I didn't know what I was doing and none of these files constitute a complete product

Today I went through and got the code compiling on GCC 14.2.0 and
CSFML 2.6

Its a nifty little demo that I will refer to when working on my repository https://github.com/BostonBrooks/Spaghetti_Graveyard_Zero
